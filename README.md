# AI-Based English Proficiency Scoring

This project evaluates English language proficiency using AI models. It processes spoken English audio and assigns a proficiency score based on extracted features and text analysis. 

The system uses:
- **Whisper** to convert speech to text.
- **Wav2Vec** to extract deep audio features.
- **BERT** for linguistic analysis.
- **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** for scoring proficiency.
