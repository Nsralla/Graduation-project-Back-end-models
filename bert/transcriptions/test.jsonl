Students learn the value of spending time to work, save, and then spend their own money rather than just spending what they've received from their parents. The third reason why working is such an important thing for students is that it gives them a wide perspective on different vocational chances that they may have to work in the future. Working in different jobs and seeing what you like the best will help you moving forward to figure out the best way for you to fit into society.

Being able to focus on something makes it a lot easier for someone to acquire enough learnings and have enough time to put it to practice as they improve it. I think that introductions are important before entering the business world because this will help you to do better and to keep up with the pace. College as a preparation is an important step before opening the doors in the corporate world because this is a road that will help you in attaining success. It is somehow a baby stage of walking so that after a few practices, you will be able to run and do things at a much faster pace.

I do think there should be a separate smoking area for people that like to smoke, but I don't think it should go as far as banning smoking in all restaurants. If people are concerned about the topic of secondhand smoke, they can choose to go to restaurants that do not have smoking areas. On the other hand, if people are not so bothered, they can go to places that have a smoking area. So I disagree with this topic. I don't think that they should go far as having a countrywide ban in all restaurants. There is also the topic of health for the employees that work there, but I think that's a separate thing."}

It is really hard to understand why people keep smoking while they have been watching the effects of smoking itself. On itself, awareness can stop addiction. And second, smoking also can bother other people. Passive smokers may have worse impacts than active ones. It is because they breathe in the cigarette smoke from any smoker that they met.

Having experience also shows that you have had some real-world experience and that you can handle yourself outside of the campus. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse because there are many options available for part-time work. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allows them to engage with the students all the time, make them learn or price them to a place where they have probably found a good job. If you have no student experience thus far, you have them in your etcetera be 130 percent it gives them a way to improve themselves.

Because the research says that people who are smoking are more at risk instead of the people who are smoking themselves.

However, there are restaurants that do allow smoking and there isn't a smoking section which can be offensive to those who don't smoke. I personally do not like to eat at a restaurant where there is smoking and it depends on where you're at. In the States, there may be restaurants that have a smoking and non-smoking section.

But smoke harms everybody who are near the smoker. Many people visit the places with this family to run around to their good time. But that and smoke spoils their good evening and restaurant. That is why smoking in the restaurant must be banned. Diarrhea must be drawn for smokers so that they don't disturb other people, because smokers spoil their ears with that nasty smell.

And they do not need to be exposed to that. If people do want to smoke when they go to a restaurant, maybe the restaurant could compromise and have a space away from the door where people could go if they so desire to smoke, so you do not feel that they should be allowed to smoke inside the restaurant at all.

I think it's quite reasonable to ban smoking at the vast majority of restaurants. After all, nowadays, most people don't smoke. I think we need to take account of their tastes. It's also important for people who work in restaurants and who would be otherwise exposed to smoke, secondhand smoke, every day. I'm not sure, actually, I'm not convinced myself by the sundering data against secondhand smoking, but even so, I think those workers have a benefit in the doubt, should have a benefit in the doubt. Especially as they may be part-time workers, they may be people who are quite poor and have no choice but to work there. On the other hand, I don't think it's fair to ban it completely. I think there should be one in 10 or one in 20 restaurants that are licensed to allow smoking. That could be looked after by the police in the same way that the number of licensed pops is decided by the police. I think that way, you'd give a smoker a chance for smoke, but you also wouldn't force workers to work in that particular restaurant. There'd be plenty of choice for them to work in other places."}

I have a friend who did a part-time job before because he wanted to buy something. It was actually quite expensive, so she decided to find her own money. Second, the experience itself when doing a part-time job will make the college students easier to have a real job after they graduate. First, they'll get another friend.

So definitely one of the advantages of a part time job is that it provides us with those experiences working with people of the other sex but not only that, also learning how to work as a member of a team in a workplace following the rules of an employer and also learning the value and the meaning of earning money for ourselves."}

So gaining a work experience is as a very good step for them to well equip before going to the society. And they have to know how to communicate with different people. As I've mentioned, going to a society means that you have to cope with stress, you have to meet different people so you can learn a lot from your part-time job. Coming stress, time management, interpersonal skills, there are too many benefits that I could mention for a part-time job. And besides, you can earn money. College students already spend a lot of money as they have to pay their school fees.

First, smoking is harmful both for the passive smokers and the active smokers themselves. Smoking can cause some diseases such as lung cancer, breast cancer, impotent heart disease, miscarriage for pregnant women, and many more because the cigarette itself contains dangerous substances such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, ammonium, and so on. It is even more harmful for the passive smokers. Second, smokers spend much money to buy the cigarettes. It's better to spend money for something which has a good benefit than to buy something which clearly can be harmful for our heart, like cigarettes. We can spend our money to buy a vegetable, to do sports, or to buy something else which is good for our heart. I think buying cigarettes has no good benefit."}

I support this statement because I think banning the smoke brings a lot of positive effects to both smokers and non-smokers. For smokers, it is well known that smoking is bad for their health because of the substances in the smoke. For example, cigarettes will bring harmful effects, for example nicotine, and will cause them to have lung cancer. So banning or restricting their places for them to smoke may help them. For non-smokers, if we do not smoke and smoking is banned in restaurants, we will have a cleaner place and a place with fresh air to eat. So for both smokers and non-smokers, it is good for them."}

For example, I have a friend who wants to travel to Europe and need about 20,000 RMB. It's far more than what his parents can give him. He needs to do some part-time jobs to earn that extra money. The second point is that we can get some experience from such part-time jobs. It's very helpful for us in finding future jobs and makes us mature.

Abraham Lincoln, I believe, always said that your right to swing your fist ends where the other person's job begins. In this case, it would be where their lungs begin. I guess there's an argument that can be made about having smoking exceptions or that kind of thing.

And also, it's very difficult to make a smoking and non-smoking section in a restaurant because of course smoke travels in the atmosphere. So even if one is not smoking or is trying to avoid smoke, you cannot really do that. However, I think smoking also adds to the atmosphere of certain kinds of restaurants.

Like for example, there are various dining places here that offer alfresco dining would be a good practice. Some people have problems in digesting food and salivating, thus having the need for smoking. Another consideration is placing a small utility room inside the area in which one can practice smoking. This is the place in which one can either enter and twist in without affecting others.

Many college students kind of take universities time to kind of depart, which it is, but it's also time to prepare and get ready for a future to do that through your studies, through your classes, but also at the same time you're building experience by having a part-time job.

I have a friend who did a part-time job before because he wanted to buy something. It was actually quite expensive, so she decided to find her own money. Second, the experience of doing a part-time job will make it easier for college students to have a real job. A third degree rate, but they'll get another friend. Third, do they offer the person a college life, maybe because one of the reasons too is because college students already have a hard time working on their homework, presentations, or simply with their textbooks the whole night for extensive preparation.

Secondly, second smoke actually affects other customers in the restaurants as well. Therefore, smoking is not something which is limited to just the individual but also to those who are around it.

I believe that one goes to college to study and to learn more about the world and the specific subject that one is studying. And I think that in order to do so, one must commit oneself fully to the endeavor. One should not divide one's time and energy between a part-time job and college if one unless it's absolutely necessary in terms of supplementing the finances.

So in a way, smoking will help fund the government projects and in terms of its benefits to the economy in the long run in terms of these kind of projects to better develop the infrastructure of Singapore. Secondly, there are negative health effects from smoking in terms of affecting the individual who smokes and so as the people surrounding the individual due to the secondhand smoking.

I particularly subscribe to the disagreeing statement because I feel that there are other ways to inculcate discipline and responsibility, which is through household chores and even living on your own. Particularly I feel that in this time before students go out to work, they should be given time to explore their interests and to discover what their true passion is and their calling is about before actually launching themselves into the working world. Of course, if those who have an idea of what they want to do, I think working part-time in specific areas which they are sure to go into would be helpful for their further development."}

But while these are the good points of having a part-time job, they are also the negative side of having a part-time job if students are not able to manage their time well because they have to balance between school and work.

It also depends on how long you spend on the job. So if you're spending one to two days a week on the weekends, then it's okay. But if you're spending five days a week and it's affecting your studies, then it may not be as advisable for you to do that. And it also depends on what's the purpose of studying.

However, there may be some people who argue that it is important for college students to start having work experience early, so that they will prepare for their working life next time. However, this requires a very delicate balance between work and study, so as not to disrupt either. For example, if they attribute too much time for their work, they may neglect their studies. And similarly, if they emphasize too much on studies, they may not do well at their part-time job and may end up getting fired, which will arguably be more detrimental to their resume than not having work experience."}

This actually generates more stress for him in the course of study, and also at the same time adversely affects his grades. However, having a job could also relieve his financial burdens.

We would not want to always depend on our parents. So as such, many of my friends give tuition as it gives good money and the hours taken for each session is not really long.

Firstly, the cost of education around the world is rising. Let's take for example the case of Singapore. Every year the rates for university fees actually goes up every year. So in the course of education in my country Singapore, I find that it is essential that students actually take up a part-time job to earn at least a fair bit of income so as to supplement the cost of education in addition to that which provided by their parents. Secondly, majority of students actually don't pursue postgraduate studies upon graduation and after their period in college they will actually transit straight into the workforce.

I've worked part-time while studying before and I know how difficult it is to put in 100% in both the workplace and the school place. So to be honest, it also gives a great sense of achievement when you have done both well.

Yeah, because especially those who participate a lot, they might not be able to manage their time well enough. However, on the other hand, I agree mostly because you can earn extra cash. You do not have to be dependent on your parents because of this extra money. As well, the student is getting extra money from their parents or his or her parents as well. So with the extra cash, I feel that they will spend their money wisely, like they'll be able to tell what they should spend on and what they should not spend on.

Some of my friends, they don't take allowance from their parents anymore and they are actually able to support themselves and in that sense, it is part of growing up and becoming an adult and taking responsibility for yourself and that is very good.

Now, as you know, a part-time job is usually, or rather you can see it as a precursor of a full-time occupation. And what I think is very important is because having a part-time job, by having a part-time job, you give it to experience what it will be like in the future once you start, once you embark on a career in the working world. Now, experiences, they come in many different forms. For example, you get to see how it is like, for example, to wake up early in the morning and to come back home at the end of the day.

If my restaurant is a closed one, smoking inside would cause the smoke to remain inside the restaurant, causing secondhand smoke to other people who comes in to my restaurant.

So I don't see the banning as a severe curtailing of their rights. Human rights to do whatever they want. They have the right to smoke. If they choose to smoke, they should respect the decision of non-smokers to not smoke or to not take in secondhand smoke especially. So I believe that would be a fair way of going about doing it. And therefore I believe that there should be a complete ban on smoking in restaurants so that non-smokers are not exposed to it. It's not unnecessary."}

However, I do believe that at the end of the day, each and every one of us should have the right to choose for themselves, for himself or herself, what he or she would want to consume. However, if that choice is negatively affecting others around them, then perhaps other alternatives or other arrangements can be made for these people who choose to smoke, such as for example giving them a designated location to smoke, or perhaps limiting their times at which they can smoke, or just other means through which you can have a compromise, as the best of both worlds, where you allow the choice of smoking to be had, and at the same time to protect those..."}

So by banning smoking in Singapore, actually it's in line with our society's expectations because smoking generally dies in the private sphere instead of the public sphere. So the social construct of smoking is actually very bad and the next thing is that they actually don't condone smoking in public places. So banning smoking in Singapore is perfectly fine unless we are talking about tourism because sometimes they are not too sure about whether we can smoke in restaurants. So they might make a bit of noise but I think it's perfectly fine because even in overseas countries, they also take negative smoking areas and non-smoking areas. So just don't smoke during your..."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_034_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " I feel that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Singapore because of three reasons. The first is personal health to smokers because smoking has been directly linked to many diseases such as cancers and respiratory diseases. Secondly, smoking in a restaurant affects not just the smoker themselves but also the people dining around him. In Singapore, there's the policy of a smoking corner marked out by a yellow box that allows smokers to continue smoking while not affecting the other people around them. But the thing is, smoke does not simply stay in an area, it goes with the wind. So if restaurants ban smoking, then everybody will not be affected by smoke. So there will be no secondhand smoke that's inhaled by people that are dining near smokers. And lastly, for the good of the taste of food, smoking should be banned in restaurants because after you smoke, your taste buds get affected."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_032_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " So having a ban for smoking at all restaurants would be important because yes, smoking is bad for you and secondly, people are there to enjoy food and to bond with one another and I believe that not all people there do appreciate smokers, having smokers in the facility while they're having their meals. And smokers should have a designated separate place where they are able to smoke and to also contain that smoke in that area where non-smokers can go about without being affected by the smoke. So in restaurants, yes, all restaurants would have the ban that smoking is not allowed because firstly, it's bad for your health and secondly, it affects other people. So not all people who go to the restaurants appreciate that, having the health compromise. So yes, I believe that all restaurants should have the ban."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_026_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " I think that, as I said earlier, I think smoking should not be continued in restaurants because these people might have smoking as an avenue to chill out with their friends. And I think that smoking should be banned within the air-conditioned areas of the restaurant because, as you know, the air will get stuck in the enclosed area and it will be bad for the other customers. The government should maybe legalise smoking in outside corridors as this will allow them to continue in their activities. They should have a designated area so that the smoke do not travel around and harm other consumers in the community. Also, I think it's a bit of resorting to other heads over 70. Smoking usually gives them a lot of trouble."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_018_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " I believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants because smoking spoils the ambiance and environment in the restaurant. I believe that people go to the restaurant to enjoy their meals, to have a relaxing environment, and to enjoy the ambiance, and to chat over dinners or lunches with their friends. Smoking spoils the enjoyment of non-smokers who are trying to enjoy all these services and privileges in the restaurant. The restaurant has also specially prepared all these services for their guests to enjoy, and it would be disrespectful to do so while excluding other people from enjoying the same kind of services."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_037_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " Other than the negative health effects on the smoker and the people around him or her, smoking is also costly. Cigarettes tend to be very expensive and smokers who are heavy smokers will spend a lot of money in order to buy these cigarettes and keep up with this bad habit of theirs. As such, they would spend a large proportion of their income, and some of whom may not even be able to afford that amount and that cost incurred by cigarettes. Also, smoking, while smoking can be detrimental, there is a positive effect in terms of economic benefits for the country. And this can be seen in how they are heavy smokers."}

Hence, it is very irresponsible for smokers to smoke when there are non-smokers around in the restaurant. However, smoking is a way to relax and help respond people with the same smoking habit. Hence, it should not be completely banned. That's to make the smoking area should be prepared by the restaurant so that smokers can have a common area to smoke. This will prevent non-smokers from reading in secondhand smoke, which is hazardous to their health. Lastly, the taxation earned from the sale of cigarettes can help fund government projects and hens."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK2_021_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants completely because most non-smokers will not like having smoke in the restaurants while they are eating and it causes a lot of discomfort for them, it causes a lot of smell that is not very favourable. So for themselves, when they are in a restaurant, it's an enclosed area, it's in an air-con place so the smell is very strong and it will stay on their clothes. So I believe that non-smokers will feel that it isn't a nice thing to be enjoying while we are eating and being in a restaurant. Also, second-hand smoking is very unhealthy and it causes a lot of diseases and it causes cancer so I think most people dislike the second-hand smoking also because they are cozy they find it together."}

It can also kill more people and it affects more people and it also may ruin the ambiance of the diners who eat there. But at the same time, it's not possibly not possible because there's a lot of government control behind it and if you were to ban it, there will be other ways where the black market will come in and there will still be smoking happening. But even still, restaurants will not want to totally ban smoking because that will deter customers away from their restaurants. Therefore, it's not possible to do so. But I guess the best reason would be to have a divide between the smoking section and the non-smoking section, which is being done so right now.

And since the restaurants are usually an enclosed area and in an aircon place, the smell will actually spread and it will go onto your clothes and it will stay for the whole day. So most people actually dislike the smell and it isn't very good to have the smell like smoke basically after being in the restaurant for a long day.

{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK1_049_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " Well, smoking is harmful. It has been scientifically proven, not just to the smoker himself, but also the people around him. So in a restaurant where customers and other diners are present, the smoke will travel through diffusion. So actually, everyone in the restaurant will be able to inhale the smoke that the smoker exhales. So what happens is that, to me, as a person, I think that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants and dining areas, because it actually affects the dining experience of other people, and not just the smoker himself, but other people. Yes, and even though having designated smoking areas might help, however, but smoke still travels. So it will be better for smoking to be completely banned, because then we can actually taste the full flavor of our food, instead of having extra ingredients like that."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK1_023_B1.mp3", "label": "B1", "text": " I think smoking in restaurants, we must first analyze the function of a restaurant, which is that a restaurant is a place where people come in to dine and for comfort. By completely banning smoking, we actually disregard a group of smokers who actually decide to come to a restaurant to dine and for their own comfort. So I don't think that banning smoking completely from restaurants is actually a good thing. If it has to be done, maybe it could be done in a way that is currently being done where different parts of the restaurant are segmented to non-smoking and smoking areas. This will cater for the functions of restaurants. However, if this is a higher government order to completely stem out smoking, then I think as a healthy US law habit, I think that maybe that can be seen as a deterrence option."}
{"filename": "SM_SIN_SMK1_007_B2_0.mp3", "label": "B2", "text": " So the question this time was whether smoking should be completely banned. And in my country, there are a lot of different regulations on which places you can smoke in and which places you can't smoke in. For example, I think the current regulation is that you cannot smoke when you are within five meters from entrances to public places such as shopping malls, bus stops, and the like. So already a lot has been done to curb smoking. Other things, but when you think about it, this pushes people to smoke more in your private locations such as in your homes. And so this increases the chance of your family members or your children being exposed to secondhand smoke. And secondhand smoke, as we all know, is very harmful. There are no benefits from secondhand smoke. So in that sense, I think yes, smoking should be banned completely to help."}
