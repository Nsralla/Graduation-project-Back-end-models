In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely for several reasons. Firstly, smoking can cause serious health problems to the smokers themselves through inhaling secondhand smoke, the one that I said a while ago. Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substances including a lot of carcinogen and nicotine which is addictive. Smoking can cause cancer, epithelma and heart disease.

Third, I think some students like to follow a related fashion such as brands or something like expensive things. If they can use their money, they make a better life.

That is, during the process we can strike a work-life balance and we can learn to use our time wisely. And it is important in the aspect of time management. Also, in a part-time job we can earn money, though it may not be a lot of money, but those amount can help alleviate our family burden, that our family members don't need to give us much money and we can use the money earned in our daily life. Also, it helps us to manage our own time."}

And because also, as we all know, many parents nowadays, they cannot afford to send their children to schools because of poverty. So this is an opportunity for the youth to help them achieve their dreams or aspirations in life. So by the time they graduate, to graduate is a very big thing.

It's just a bad addiction that people get into, much like drinking alcohol, although at least in that state it's kind of a bit different. But anyway, I think it's a bad kind of habit that people develop. And no one starts out smoking, so if people just couldn't smoke because it was illegal in the first place, everyone would be much better off for it. There'd be less chance of lung cancer and also they wouldn't have to waste all their money on expensive cigarettes.

Furthermore, students learn to juggle everything that they have, including studies, friendships, relationships, as well as learning new stuff at their jobs.

This can include interacting with people better, certain skills that they've never learned before, for example, learning to use Excel sheets like my seniors told me.

This is why smoking should be banned from public places, including restaurants. If people gave up smoking inside restaurants, the atmosphere would be much cleaner, more healthy, and would attract more customers to restaurants, which would be a boon for the economy and for the restaurants themselves. If people want to continue smoking at a restaurant, then we should create a private area or room where they can smoke or an outside area where they can go to smoke.

It's a relatively recent law in the last five, ten years perhaps, but it is also something that's been happening and increasingly smoking in public areas is seen as an unpopular thing. Whether people should be allowed to wear smoke in restaurants, I don't think so. Smoking is a very personalised habit. It comes with a lot of odours, it comes with a lot of negative health effects that people are aware of but choose to ignore and it's not a pleasant environment for everybody. And then when you're in a restaurant you're in a public environment so you should be able to respect the individual as well as yourself and that means making accommodations to be flexible in both directions.

I believe that they should sharpen and work on their gifts, not squander them in jobs that are beneath them, especially since they have their entire lives to work anyway. I mean, a 16-year-old does not need to work, even though it's quite common for a 13-year-old to go to work. It's not necessary.

Now, if it's in the summer time or perhaps in the weekend where it doesn't interfere with their studies so much, sure, it could be a good idea.

On the one hand, in addition to gaining an income, college students taking a part-time job can enjoy a more exciting lifestyle, as they can meet people from all walks of life and develop a sense of responsibility which can be learned in the classroom. On the other hand, students who take a part-time job may have less time focused on study, and if they seek excel in both the part-time job and study, the people they meet may improve their health at a speed.<|br|><|translate|> the"}

I have a part-time job, especially in the holiday, in semester holiday, because I have a one-until-two-month holiday, so I think that it's not for me, just for enjoying my holiday. So I take that part-time job, for example, I'm selling food or drinks, and it must be a valuable experience that I have ever done. Some people who did not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty after they get the job. It is difficult to get the money. So I learned a lot of things by doing this part-time job. So we should experience many things and get a correct view. So I think it's important to do this part-time job."}

If people are still able to buy cigarettes and smoke in other public places, for example, on the street, then I believe that they should be able to contribute to society by going to restaurants and other public venues. But I don't believe that the general public who chooses not to smoke should be exposed to this now.

So for the benefit of like the pregnant women and future generations, I think smoking should definitely be banned and also for people with asthma because they have, it might trigger their asthma and asthma can be quite a dangerous condition if the asthma is very severe. So I think just for the benefit of people who smoke, I mean just for the benefit of people who do not smoke, we should definitely completely ban smoking and also if smoking is banned in more areas, I think it will, it could also act as a deterrent for people who want to smoke, it could discourage people from smoking and I think that's why it's worth thinking."}

I mean, admissions rely on outgoing, friendly students to give group tours or even personal tours and talk to potential students about all that the college has to offer. If you think it's a job for you, you should ask your admissions department about the openings. Not only is it a job that looks good on you, as you may, but it's also convenient because you don't even have to leave campus to get to work. Having to think about work is pretty hard for a college student, but gives them more responsibility. Freshman seminar classes can have as many as 500 students enrolled.

In the case of the United States, one of the recent issues that we've been dealing with is the fact that college tuition, the cost of university has been rising considerably and it's become so expensive that many college students have to take a part-time job or somebody's taking a full-time job in order to get income to pay for their living expenses for their textbooks and to pay for tuition. However, in the case of Japan, I might disagree and say that we do not, that college students should not take a part-time job because during college it's one of the few times in their life in Japan, Japanese society, when they have so much free time that they can try many different things and join many different clubs in order to gain new experiences and meet new people and try new things and discover new things.

I also think that it will be a good experience for them since they will be handling different personalities in their jobs and in school. And I think this will be a good training for their future.

Therefore smokers should not subject others who do not smoke to the toxins that are in the things they burn with their cigarettes. So that is one reason why people should not smoke in restaurants.

And last, especially in the restaurants, if you smoke, that actually disgusts people that are eating. Nobody wants to... Nobody can eat happily in a smoking..."}

The most common of the sections is the difference between the sections of the job and outcomes of the family which is more important than the degree of the study. This section was a data problem.

You will understand how the world works and you will also understand what it feels like to work for what you have. Secondly, schools are expensive. The only way to pay off those student loans is still depending on your parents is to pay with your own money and this money will be earned through your part-time jobs. Thirdly, there is no point in just learning stuff off the books in universities. You need experience from internships. It is very important because you have to know how to apply what you learn in college into what you actually do in real life. These internships are actually part-time jobs which specialize in your major that you take in university and this is highly, highly important if you do not want to succeed in whatever it is that you want to work."}

It's especially important for restaurants that also cater to children and the people who might not be in the best of health because those are the people who are going to be affected the most by someone who is smoking in the restaurant. I feel that they can be compromised if patrons really want to smoke. There should be a designated area outside away from the door of the restaurant where people can go to smoke if they so choose but that they should not be allowed to smoke while they are inside the restaurant itself. Smoking creates more of a hazard for the people working."}

And so for example, when a smoker smokes, he or she may get personal gain. But at the same time, the smoker actually influences negative externalities upon the people around him or her. And in that sense, it is very inconsiderate and at the same time, it is very unpleasurable for the people around him or her.

It's very easy for a smoker to go out and smoke outside if they get the craving, but you can't really expect a nonsmoker to go outside for a breath of fresh air if they get the craving for that. And the second thing is, you've got to think of what a restaurant does. It serves food, and tobacco and smoke can affect the flavor of food.

And this is definitely not a good thing because I believe that studies should be the first priority of students. But I do understand the reasons behind all this. Some college students work because they may not have enough resources coming from their family members to supplement for their schooling. Or they probably just want to be independent.

On the other hand, part-time job can also help students to financially support their family if there are some financial problems in their families.

So when it is time for me to work again, let's say after graduation, I may not be prepared for the work environment and it may be a little bit more difficult for me.

I can't even, when I go in somewhere like a ramen shop that everyone smokes in, I can't even smell the delicious food. I can only smell cigarette smoke and that doesn't really make me want to eat. The only time I smoke is when I'm not eating. So those aren't really compatible in my mind and it's not healthy for other people to have to inhale secondhand smoke.

Some people are able to attend school without working and some people are able to attend school with working. So it depends on the situation. However, having a job while attending college at the same time does produce characteristics of being responsible and disciplined and teaching you how to multiply tasks, different things, while having to work and go to school, which are two of the important tasks that everyone has to deal with.

So actually doing part-time work actually ails us, the financial burden on us and also on our parents. And furthermore, we also do not wish to be too financially burdened after we actually graduate so that we can spend more time concentrating on our work rather than paying back the bank loans and also paying back our parents as well. And I also feel that doing part-time work is also a very important way to show how a student can actually manage a multi-class, like how we can juggle with our studies at the same time committing to part-time work.

So, having a part-time job seems like a way to be in this complicated society in advance, but at the same time you'll miss out a lot in campus, which you won't have in a chance after you graduate, which makes you a part-time worker and a part-time student. And part-time job is definitely a way to learn, but I think it's probably better to do it during holidays, like in winter or in summer vacations.

One thing that I've noticed that it seems to vary very much by country. So in the United States, college tuition is very, very expensive. And while many families can afford to send their kids to college with government assistance or without government assistance, other families will have to use government assistance and then ask the student to work simultaneously, either through the college employment office that would subsidize the tuition or the room and board or outside and then using that money towards tuition. It's a big economic problem in the United States. In Japan, I think that from what I've seen and what I've heard, a lot of part-time work is just a fun play time where college tuition, even at private schools, there's nowhere near the amount of money required in the United States."}

People working there are exposed to secondhand smoke all the time, although it's not absolutely clear how much secondhand smoke really is. I think we need to give them the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, I don't think it should be banned completely. I think that a small number, say one in ten or one in twenty, should be licensed, probably by the local police in the same way that pubs are, to allow smoking. That way people could go and smoke somewhere, and the people who work there wouldn't be obliged to work at that particular place because there would be plenty of other places they could work. This, I think, would be a fair compromise between the needs of the smoker and of the non-smoker, particularly the non-smoking staff."}

Working part-time job can also give you more experience because you are stepping into the workforce and then people, you are able to interact with people and you are able to learn the ropes of doing your job properly and so I think apart from monetary gains, you also get some sort of valuable experience and examples of part-time job include working as baristas in Starbucks or in Singapore."}

It's bad for your health and it's even bad for the external corks. The statistics say that secondhand smoking is more dangerous than firsthand smoking itself because there is no filter that the external corky can use to lessen the effects of the chemicals inside the cigarette, which is very bad for their health. Cigarette smoking is considered to be one of very deadly vices in this world. It can really kill through cancer and all those other diseases and it can even make you look ugly. It can even decrease your immune system and even brain function. It is very bad and it should be banned because people take this for granted."}

It can be a mean of earning and mean of spending or paying their expenses.

Secondly, the smell of cigarettes is potentially off-putting to other people who are trying to eat. Even for me, I tend to choke and cough a bit when I get exposed to these smokes from other smokers."}

It should be alright banned, however I'm not a smoker so I suppose it should be for me to say that. And I do know that the taxes will bring a lot of money into the country, so smoking was banned. I think a substitute would need to be implemented to bring in extra money, which actually could be an opportunity through legalisation of that order. But yes, I don't think it should be banned.

You want to be able to taste and smell all the things that you want to eat as opposed to the smell of tobacco and smoke and nicotine and whatever really. So I think that's definitely a good idea. Certainly noticed in Japan that you can smoke in a lot of places inside still which is quite strange for a developed country. I know a lot of Western countries and European countries and such don't allow that anymore. There's no smoking or non-smoking, it's just all non-smoking. So I think that's probably a good idea."}

And, you know, health is such an important part of our lives. So that is definitely one of the reasons why smoking should be banned. And I think the second reason would be that there are people who are not smokers, but when they're in the street, maybe like waiting to cross the road or just lining up for bus, there will always be a smoker there. And then they would just smoke and..."}

I think that they need the experience of being in a job, having a job and being around other people, working with other people, that they need to have that experience before they enter a full-time workplace because I think that'll give them a better idea of what is expected of them when they do get to a real job.

I have very sensitive nostrils. My nose gets stuffed up and clogged very easily. I have trouble breathing. When you have a non-smoking and smoking section, it doesn't really do anything because of the way the density of smoke works. If someone smokes on one side of the room, what happens is the density of smoke becomes equal all across the room so that everyone gets to secondhand smoke equally. And I think that's really unfair.

If they do part-time jobs, they can buy what they want or buy what their parents want.

And also you learn how to manage your time well because if the job or studies can work at the same time, and I think this is an important skill, especially when you graduate and go into the working industry next thing. Also, it teaches us skills that we can't actually learn from the school, like relationship, management relationships, or like working in a team, or like, you know, how to handle customers, I think that's really important.

Since they will have as much free time as they have to plan around their work schedule and plan around their classes, they'll be able to budget their time better and prepare for being ready for work and doing their studying and doing their homework and preparing for everything they need to do every day so they'll be able to learn the responsibility of budgeting their time wisely and prioritizing what's important and what's not. Another area of responsibility they'll learn about is the money. Students with part time jobs will feel more of an ownership with the money rather than if their parents are paying for them. So they'll begin to budget the money wisely, work hard for it, and they'll begin to plan what needs to be done so they can have the over-activated pocket money."}

The first reason is that students need to spend time outside of the university setting and academic learning system in order to learn how to socialize with people. Socializing with people in a working environment is a very important thing that usually is not taught in colleges or universities. This is the first reason why it's very important for college students to have a part-time job. The second reason is that having a part-time job helps students learn the value of money. Spending time to work somewhere and make money lets students know that it takes time and effort in order to save money to buy things rather than to just receive money from your parents or other people to buy things for you. So responsibility and freedom is a very important lesson that is taught by part-time jobs."}

And this means that they have the actual money to use and also it means they have a feeling of independence themselves. Another reason would be so that they can learn some skills that they can't necessarily learn in a university.

For example, the student could consider joining as a co-curator at Prifidies and taking up perhaps leadership positions. Or he could also consider joining an internship which gives him a more in-depth view into the company or the work that he or she wants to do in the future.

In fact, lung cancer is included in the most common cancers in the world. Let us be reminded that second-hand smoking is far more dangerous than the first-hand smoking.

Many non-smokers like me against smoking in public places like bars, restaurants and parks. I totally agree to be banned. The biggest mistake is that a smoker thinks smoking is harmful only in life when they smoke. Smoking harms for everybody who are near the smoker. Restaurants where people come with their family, their children for enjoyable time but the smoking bad smell and smoke spoil your good time and enjoyable time. So that's why it should be banned. Sometimes I think how interesting. You go to the restaurant and you order to a fresh water, to wait for fresh water."}

So, if a student has the good grades and is responsible then the part-time job is good. But the student who is careless and has no desire to do well in the school will use the part-time job as an lame excuse. So, it's all about the time management and it really depends upon the student. It's not a possibility. I'm not saying that you have to do work for 40 hours a week in a factory but spending less than 20 hours after schooling on a weekend would make them realize the importance of things. But money doesn't grow on trees and how it's hard to buy a thing you want on a budget. And it also teaches you the critical thinking, critical skills, values. Still, I think at this time in life your profession is just good and learning should come first and then the job is second."}

When you're breathing in, you don't have any control. And it's going all over you and you stink. You've got the health issues pertaining to it. So it's really just something that needs to be done. It's one thing. They're very proactive in America. Almost all restaurants in the area can't smoke in. And even more recently, even bars, like the Isekai in Japan, you wouldn't be able to smoke in if you're not smoking. So it is a very controversial topic. And I can understand why some people wouldn't be able to go and drink and smoke. But people have to remember that when you drink, you're not affecting the person next to you. You're damaging your own body. But when you smoke, you're affecting those all around you, whether they choose to accept it or not. So that's my main argument."}

They can also learn about job responsibility, and they can learn some job skills that may be helpful in their future. On the other hand, I think that not all students must have a part-time job. Some students have the luxury of not having to have a part-time job. It can be good because they can focus on their studies. They can have more free time to do what they'd like to do, which is important in university, and they can also spend more time studying and doing their classroom work.

They can also provide other outcomes which economic, or economic educational institutions are unable to provide. How do we get along with superiors who are mistaken?

However, if a college student faces financial difficulties or distress, then maybe they should start looking for a part-time job. Well, looking for a part-time job is not just about the money. By getting a part-time job, you can also gain invaluable experiences on the job, such as you can pick up scales, you can pick up office skills, you can pick up clinical skills, you can pick up even interpersonal skills when you deal with customers. And this will actually better equip students for the job."}

Another good thing about having experience or doing a part-time job or the like during college is that it makes you, or it gives you more contacts in the field of your choice.

The smoke spreads around and can interfere with people around them, people who are non-smokers. And this is not only unhealthy for them, but the smell of it clings to the clothes and they have to carry that smell with them then for the rest of the day or evening. And I would often, if I went out to restaurants where people were smoking around me, when I came home I would just have to put all my clothes in the wash and then probably want to take a shower to remove that smell. And also I'd been breathing that smoke, as well, which isn't healthy, and that's something which I didn't ask for. So to have no smoking in all the restaurants is going to be a huge benefit to all of the people who do not smoke."}

Because, number one, what time-traps can create the chance of independence for the student itself. Because we know that students need public money or time control. So if the students are picking up time-traps, they need to be thinking about their own money. So they will not be dependent anymore on the money that is earned by their parents. And number two, our time-traps can teach the student how to experience the real job. Our time-traps can be used as a pre-working activity that can help the student adapt in the future. So the final part of time-traps is the efficient visualization of how they will work in the near future."}

On the other hand, oh and by the way a student also needs money to enjoy himself because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. On the other hand, if the student spends too much time at his part time job the student may not be able to function properly at school. He may not, for example, he or she may not be able to complete all their assignments. He or she may be too tired to work hard during the day. The student may be obliged to miss lessons.

For me, I actually disagree with this statement because I feel that there are other avenues, other platforms for students to actually take on responsibility and also discipline, whether it be to working, doing the household chores or even living alone, doing one's laundry. I feel that all these things help and especially being from the army, I think that has helped because I feel that right now when we are students, we should be given a time for discovery and for exploration."}

A restaurant isn't a smoking area. A restaurant is a place for one or more individuals to eat together. If they want to smoke, they should smoke outside because when people smoke, it is more harmful to the people around them more than the smoker itself. A cigarette has a self-filter for the smoker himself, but for the people around the smoker, they are simply relying on nothing. They have no filter at all. It is better if the smoker smokes inside a place or outside where there aren't that much people around so that he wouldn't harm any people from the contents."}

It will also decrease the burden on his parents. And second, it will add to the student experience and managing skill in life that leads to increased confidence level of experience. It increases confidence level and he also comes to know how to manage between college and job. And part-time job also helps with developing better economic condition and he also learns new things which take a long time from books and school.

Smoking can cause heart problems such as impotence, lung disease, heart attack, and problem in pregnancy.

So I really think that preventing people from smoking protects everybody health-wise in the restaurant.

But as an individual vice, it's something that should be left up to the individual in the privacy of their home. Banning it entirely I don't think is reasonably possible.

The reason is because there are many scientific studies that have gone to show and it is empirically proven that smoking isn't really good for one's health and it is in fact a form of addiction just like how you would be taking drugs.

The other reason why it's good for college students to have part-time jobs is because you can learn good, you can learn to have good communication skills, which will be very important once you graduate and work full-time. If you work part-time, you would automatically have to report to your boss."}

College is very different from high school. In high school, all you do is just study different fields, different disciplines. But in college, you have to choose what is your major, what will be your future job, your future career. So a part-time job, it's really helpful to a college student because, first of all, as early as college, it will help them earn money. It will teach them how to use this hard-earned money. It will also help them in their training in college as well because college is about training yourself for working. So in college, if they have a part-time job, as early as that, they'll learn to work already. So a part-time job is really important for a college student."}

Furthermore there is this issue of second hand smoke which would affect those who are constantly exposed to the smokers.

So if you are in need of money and the part-time job is how you can maintain your pay or living expenses, then I think in that way, a part-time job is important for college students. Because I mean, we don't have any income from university and we don't have any money at all. So part-time job would be important for those who need extra income for maybe because their family is not as well off.

I mean going to a club or a bar and having to smell other people's smoke really ruined the night. Sometimes it's absolutely suffocating. Secondhand smoke is very dangerous because there's no filter. The ability of smoke works if somebody's smoking on the other side of the room. The density of smoke will be equivalent on the completely other side of the room as it is to the area right around the smoker. That's just the way smoke works. So that person sitting right beside a smoker will get the secondhand smoke just as badly across the room. You shouldn't have to be smelling any smoke at all. And so having a non-smoking section doesn't really help any because the smoke comes over from the smoking section. If you're walking to the washroom and you pass by the smoking section, you can smell that and that increases your chance of getting lung cancer. It's not fair. It definitely should be illegal for people who aren't even smoking. It's ridiculous."}

A lot of people are sensitive to smoke and a lot of people are uncomfortable around someone who is smoking and it can ruin their experience at a restaurant and ruin their taste for the food and it can just make the family experience not as enjoyable.

Well, secondly, apart from health hazardous, being forced to breathe tobacco smoke is annoying and irritating to most people, especially people who have chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis, which makes them susceptible to tobacco smoke, and young children who are very sensitive to cigarette smoke. It should be noted that many activities such as playing loud music, engaging in sexual provocative activity, dressing in inappropriate scanty attires, are banned in public places simply because they are annoying and irritating, and that is the same as smoking. In addition, discarded cigarette butts can be a big problem. Cigarette butts constitute an overwhelming majority of litter, and in many public places such as parks, beaches,"}

So, it's not a good thing for you because as known by the research, second hand smoking is actually worse than the first hand smoking. One last thing about the restaurant is that the restaurant is actually open. It's actually a freedom country, it's a republic, so just in the Philippines, you guys can, it's okay to smoke inside the restaurant, but it's better not to, just to think of your health and also think about other people's health.

However, I think it also depends very much on the type of establishment that the proposal is made for. For example, in an izakaya, I don't think it would be prudent to ban smoking completely. In an izakaya, many patrons do smoke and as such, it would take away something from the experience of going to an izakaya.

So many college students need a part-time job to be able to cover those expenses on a daily basis. Many college students are suffering because they need to cover the expenses that they cannot afford while they're living on campus. So that's why many college students, they decide to get a part-time job.

If no one can agree on a specific thing, then we shouldn't have to actually have to argue about it, so just take away the smoking from the restaurants. Because so many people are compacted in the same area that it's just not right to have to have many other people suffer for the sake of one person.

There are also many negative externalities attached to smoking. When one person smokes, it will affect the quality of air of the people who are around him. However, it is actually impossible to completely ban smoking because governments earn a lot of tax revenue from selling cigarettes. When one country completely bans smoking, the country will actually lose out on quite a lot of cigarettes, a lot of revenues that they can be collected from cigarettes. I think I cannot agree."}

However, for students who actually have tests and exams or are in their final year with final projects and TCCs to write, it might not actually be a very good idea because they need full concentration and focus to finish up their studies and also do well for the examination.

Secondhand smoke is as harmful as it is to other people's health. Having said that, I believe that smoking should be illegal in all restaurants. Even if you were to have a smoking section, it doesn't stop the problem. If you were to quarantine them in a restaurant, sort of have walls built up around them, it also doesn't solve the problem of the waiters and waitresses who have to serve those people getting exposed to secondhand smoke. Now, some might say that those waiters and waitresses chose to work there and so they are exposing themselves. But that is not the case in our present economy. You take jobs that you can get for a living."}

A smoker should be considerate of those around him and refrain from smoking in a public area where there are lots of people who are there to enjoy a meal.

So in order to lessen their family burden and to become self-dependent it is essential to have a part-time job.

I do think there should be separate smoking areas for people that want to smoke and a non-smoking area also for people that want to get away from the smoke, but I do not think it should be so extreme as to ban smoking in all restaurants. I think the restaurant owners should have a choice of having a restaurant as they like, including smoking area or not, and I think the customers should have the choice of choosing a restaurant with some smoking area."}

Nowadays many people have situations in health concerns, to asthma and other situations where smoke is not healthy for them. So first it should be banned for the safety of those who cannot or should not be around smoke, such as those with asthma and other respiratory problems. So if it's banned, then no one will have to worry about having an asthma attack or being around smoke. It's often to have reactions and health concerns. Also, this should be banned for the sake of the smoker because many of them do not realize what health hazards are in smoking. If it's banned, they cannot get involved with smoking even though the peer pressure may have to do it or other reasons."}

Given the very high prices and taxes on cigarettes and cigars and tobacco in Singapore, smoking is generally very discouraged in Singapore and many people actually look down on smoking. So when people smoke, people actually do it in a private sphere, they do it secretly, they don't really do it openly. So I think by banning smoking in Singapore, it's probably fine and actually in lieu, not in lieu, it's actually in line with social expectations of Singapore society.

So having a part-time job in college can have good and bad effects. I think as we continue to go on, you know, in gaining an education for the next two to three generations, we will have to have part-time jobs because, like I said, school is getting extremely expensive and the financial aid that is offered to most students probably won't cover any of school.

But then again it takes away from your studies because you can't study and work at the same time. And obviously it's really important to do well at university because you're spending all of that money there and getting in debt, but then you need to have a job at the same time to be able to sustain a life. So I think most students do need part-time jobs unless they're lucky enough to be able to have their parents to pay for their students' years outright and then they can spend all their time studying, which would be much better because then you get much higher grades and then a better job at the end of it, which is what I want to do, but unfortunately my parents can't afford that. So I'm going to have to get a part-time job and continue working at it while I study, but making sure that doesn't take away too much from my grades because that's the most important thing, otherwise I can't go to Japan and study.

At the same time, it's very important to gain experience in working. For instance, if in future after you graduate from college, you have to go for interviews, you have to go for like really interviews where people will, all the judges will actually look out for experience and when you work at part-time jobs, they will actually give you a good exposure to work life, so you at least have a general image, general idea of how working life is about."}

Just as I should be entitled to my right to be in a restaurant and not have smoke in my face, similarly, there should be opportunities. There should be types of restaurants or parts of restaurants that are cordoned off and sectioned off where people can smoke if that's what they want to do. Culture comes into this again.

If the student comes from a very comfortable financial situation, one in which they're not worried about money, they're not taking up loans to complete their studies, and they're not strapped for cash, so to speak, then it's perfectly reasonable for them to not have a part-time job so that they can focus on their studies. However, if the student in question is not coming from such a comfortable financial situation, or in other words, if they're taking out student loans, if they're not coming from a rich family, or if they're the majority of college students, then finances are very much a part of their life, so they can have the option to contemplate other crane rules."}

The part-time job really helps you grow up also.

It may be useful in preparing them for job interviews where they may be asked questions about whether or not they have any experience of actual work. It involves responsibilities, for example. And it may even be useful to them as a student because if they're taking a test like the TOIC, they will be required to show a certain real-world knowledge of business, which they probably wouldn't have without a job. On the other hand, I think it's important that they don't spend too much time doing their part-time job because it will interfere with their schoolwork. They will not be able to complete all their assignments, they may miss some classes, they may be very tired and unable to perform properly. So I think the important thing is not whether you have a part-time job or not, but that the part-time job is balanced against the rest of your academic life. That's the most important thing."}

It is true before getting a permanent job or a big job, every people should have to get experiences about what they will be doing in the future. When college students have a job, they will earn money. Some of these students need the money to pay for expensive schools, while other students need it to make their life easier. Some college students will not worry about many things in their life such as food, rent, and bills especially if they obtain a lot of money from their job. Some schools are very expensive, even the parent students cannot pay all the fee for these schools. Thus, the students have to obtain a part-time job which would help them to provide money for school fees and for themselves.

And if you want to take a part-time job, you will basically work for at least four days a week, which is really hard for you to both concentrate on your schoolwork and your part-time job. But on the other hand, taking a part-time job will be also a necessary step for many of the college students before they get into this society.

The second reason is that if we choose a part-time job, we can make pay time."}

For example, if they want to buy some books or coffee or food, they can buy it themselves and then they can practice this job before they get their regular job. So I think they need to, if they need to get a job such as a part-time job. That's why I think about that."}

Well, for me it's good because it can teach you a lot of things. For example, you can learn how to be more responsible. You can learn how real life really is because you have to work hard for it while, of course, studying. So you kind of get an idea what your life's going to be after college. Because after college you really have to work hard just to earn. When you don't have a job, when you don't have any experience before having a job, you don't know what to do. You get surprised, you get shocked by the things you do."}

If you know you have a habit that's bad, should you therefore inflict it on other people or not? I grew up with my grandfather smoking, so I'm very used to being in an environment where there is cigarette smoke and tobacco being consumed. It doesn't mean I necessarily like it and I certainly don't think I should condone it or want to continue that tradition just because I grew up with it. I think it's more important to be able to respect other people's spaces, especially when you're in a public environment, because you're not on your own at that point, so you should take into consideration a larger area and realise that you are responsible for your own actions as well as being aware of your own actions."}

And then also you avoid damage to the facilities, the property of the restaurant by cigarette ashes falling or whatever.

For example, in Osaka you have a thing called KidZania. Children from 3 to 15 can work in a job until they're 15 to go out into the actual workforce. And in Japan, time is money, don't be late, not like many English people I work with turn up 10 minutes before their job and that's not punctuality.

Many non-smokers are eventually smoking in public places like restaurants and hotels and they totally agree the biggest mistake is that people think that they harm themselves when they smoke but smoke harms everybody who are near the smoker. Many people sit places with their family, children and want to spend their good time but that smoke spoils their good evening at the restaurant. That is why smoking in restaurants must be banned. I also agree that smokers spoil the air with nasty smells and food which is bad for their people. Smoking affects brain, DNA, blood, heart, hormones, and stomach and we also can affect the body. Smoking our children increases the risk of serious infection and fat spirit."}

So I agree with the statement that they should get a job while they are in college that needs support. Part-time has a time which means that they will have time for their studies and they will have time to be able to work to afford their expenses.

And the second, the college life should be colorful and students should not be limited only within the university campus.

And also there is a possibility that the ashes would eventually go to the food of the other customers and that would ruin their food making the service of my restaurant bad. If my restaurant is a closed one, smoking inside would cause the smoke to remain inside the restaurant causing second-hand smoke to other people who come into my restaurant.

If a person doesn't have strong consequences and has poor financial conditions, they do a part-time job along with their service. As I was saying that positive and negative impacts, part-time job also has some positives and some negatives.
